# London Bike Sharing Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python and Tableau. It focuses on analyzing and visualizing the London Bike Sharing dataset to create an interactive dashboard.

### Features
- Data exploration and manipulation with Python and Pandas
- Interactive visualizations in Tableau
- User-defined parameters for dynamic analysis
- Set actions for dashboard control

### Data Visualization
The data is visualized using Tableau to create a dynamic dashboard. The dashboard features five visualizations:

1. Total Number of Bike Rides
2. Moving Average Chart
3. Temperature vs. Wind Speed Heat Map
4. Bike Rides Split by Weather
5. Bike Rides Split by Hour
   
The visualizations are enhanced using set actions, user-defined parameters, and calculated fields to control and filter the entire dashboard.

### Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the London Bike Sharing dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset
